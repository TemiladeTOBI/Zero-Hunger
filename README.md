The Zero-Hunger (stylised as 0-Hunger) is a proof-of-concept app run by a make-believe charity organisation to achieve hunger SDGs.
Its primary function is to connect ready donators to those in need of food in order to help deal with hunger in our society.
The app works in very simple fashion:
- users sign up either via emails or using Google as a provider;
- then users fill the donation form as desired click the "Continue" button to add the donation as "Pending";
- donators review all their pending donations thus far via the "Pending" section of the "Your Donations" tab on the Navbar;
- when, satisfied, donators click on the "Confirm Pending" button to submit their proposed donation to the organisations database;
- receivers on the other hand, are able to filter and view all donations thus far using the "Request Form" and "Search Results" features respectively;
- they then make as many requests as desired - all "pending" and viewable under the "Pending" section of the "Your Requests" tab on the Navbar;
- when, satisfied, receivers click on the "Confirm Pending" button to submit their desired donations to the organisations database;
Then, Zero-Hunger handles the rest by mobilizing the donations to the receivers.
